# Vinz [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/vinz.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/vinz)

Vinz is a SSH key management system leveraging ansible to handle a company-wide deployment of keys. Our objective is to remove the headache of managing SSH public keys for system administrators. This type of system is especially useful when leveraged in an environment with a lot of servers distributed in the cloud.

This project was originally created for a Software/Computer Engineering senior design project at Iowa State University in 2013. [View more information about the project here](http://seniord.ece.iastate.edu/may1432/).


## Dev Environment

Let's get everything set up.

### Prerequisites
	
You need to take care of a couple of things before getting started.

* [Install Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
* [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
  * NOTE: There is a bug in VirtualBox 4.3
  * Use [4.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_2) for now.
* [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Set up GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

### Checking out the code

We need to check out the code and get it on your machine locally.  Make sure you keep track of where you check out the code so that you can make changes to it.

#### Windows

If you are on Windows, I would recommend [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

#### OS X

    git clone git@github.com:mpdavis/vinz.git

### Starting VM

Our dev environment takes place inside of a VM thanks to Vagrant.  You don't have to pay much attention to this, because the code on your system is automatically synced to the right place in the VM.  However, you do need to get the VM up and going before working.
    
#### Windows

On Windows, simply double-click `run_vagrant.bat`

This will take about a minute and a half depending on your machine and network connection.  This creates the VM and installs everything needed in order to get it in a state that lets it run our code.

#### OS X

    ./run_vagrant.sh

### Developing on Vinz

At this point, the VM should be up and running.  It already has a private network connection to your machine. You can see our application in a browser by going to `http://10.13.37.2`
The dev console will begin spitting out information related to the requests coming in.

If you edit the source code on the host machine, you can reload the webpage and see your changes.  

## Problems?

This is simply written from memory.  When (not if) you run into problems, let Michael know and he will update the README.
